# VACCIBED
It's a web application that provide public with COVID bed and vaccine facilities
# Problem Statement
The admission process in a hospital is cumbersome.
Not all hospitals have the same facilities available to patients. Many who require immediate care
lack the treatment because of not exactly knowing where and which hospital provides the
required facility.
